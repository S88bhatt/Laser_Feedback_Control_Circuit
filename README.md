Contains all files for the laser feedback control circuit.

This includes the KiCAD Files that are up to date with the most recent and correct version of the circuit, the GIMP Files which are used for laser cutting the box plating, FreeCAD files which are currently used to cut the box plating into the correct shape, and a file of images which show what the physical board looks like once complete.
